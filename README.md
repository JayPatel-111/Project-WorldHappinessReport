<h1>Project: World Happiness Report</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The purpose of this analsis is to find the World Happiness Report by performing statistical analysis and visualization. It calculates the mean, median, count, and mode of the happiness scores, providing insights into the distribution of scores. The code also examines the relationships between happiness scores and variables such as GDP per capita, social support, and freedom to make life choices by calculating correlation coefficients. Scatter plots are used to visualize these relationships. Furthermore, the code presents statistical visualizations such as box plots, violin plots, and histograms to understand the distribution and variability of happiness scores. Overall, the analysis reveals that higher economic prosperity and greater freedom of choice are associated with higher happiness scores.
